## Results
Summary:

Insights are based on available data as mentioned in Data Source section and mostly depend on popularity and revenue. <br>
For a more in-depth analysis, additional data could be included, such as cost of menu items, profit margins, customer feedback, etc.

Insights:
-	Asian cuisine is the most popular category by total order volume. It ranks second in categories by revenue with Italian being the first. 
-	Asian and Italian are not only liked by customers â€“ due to higher pricing they generate more revenue.
-	Although American cuisine is least popular category by orders and revenue, menu items such as Hamburger and Cheeseburger are in the top-selling items by orders and generated revenue.
-	Korean Beef Bowl is one of the top-selling items, but it is the only bowl option in the menu.
-	The least popular menu item is Chicken tacos, followed by Potstickers.
-	Three of the five least popular items are from Mexican cuisine category.
-	Italian cuisine is mostly preferred in high-spend orders.
-	During peak hours, customers prefer Hamburger and Cheeseburger, followed by top meals from Asian cuisine.
  
Opportunities: 
-	As Italian cuisine generates the most revenue and is popular amongst high-spend orders, more Italian meals could be included in the menu.
-	Since Asian cuisine meals are highly demanded, more meals or variations (e.g., bowl options) could be introduced.
-	High-demand and high-revenue items should remain in the menu. They could be highlighted in the menu or featured in promotions. Additionally, lunch deals could be introduced. 
-	The popularity of sides shows demand for small additions to main dishes. Combo options with main meals could be offered.
- Low-revenue and low-popularity items could be considered for removal. Changes in recipes or ingredients could be explored for other items with lower popularity.
-	Reducing low performing Mexican items could create more space to introduce new options from other cuisines.

Other:
-	Understanding the reasons behind missing data (e.g., missing menu items to add or non-existing orders) would help to improve data quality.
-	Collecting additional data for longer time period could help to recognize seasonal trends.
